#### AWK

I myself been dedicated Python lover in past for many years now came to a conclusion that what can be scripted with AWK, should be scripted in AWK (over Python, Ruby, Perl, etc.). I'm not saying that you should write big apps though, but for small scripts AWK is absolutely fine alternative to major scripting languages with lots of benefits. Been universally available (as part of POSIX) and very compliant (language standard is almost unchanged for over 30 years now). As they say: "Good programmer chooses the most powerful tool for the job, the best programmer chooses the least powerful tool for the job"

I was absolutely astonished when I read a classical book [The AWK Programming Language](https://archive.org/download/pdfy-MgN0H1joIoDVoIC7/The_AWK_Programming_Language.pdf) by Alfred V. Aho, Brian W. Kernighan, Peter J. Weinberger (the A., W., K. of AWK). It was absolute pleasure to read. Amazing, but it's still totally relevant, despite been published in 1988.
